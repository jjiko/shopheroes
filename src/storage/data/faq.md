####Q. When certain blueprints show quality/skill at mastering, do I get it randomly? Like I master sth and get either flawless everytime or skill?

A. It's saying to have the skill the item must be flawless quality or higher.<br><br>

####Q. How do I level quickly?

A. Sell expensive items. Your heroes will buy items 5-7 levels higher than their level. Either focus your effort on mastering blueprints of higher levels or buy higher level items from the Trade House. Higher quality items will give more XP.<br><br>

> Experience is gained solely by selling items to or buying from customers. Experience gain per sale is equal to roughly 20.534% of the base price of the item bought or sold. The base price is determined solely by the item's quality, and it is not affected by giving the customer a surcharge/discount or by having a price bonus from mastery progression. <a href="http://shop-heroes.wikia.com/wiki/Player_Level" target="_blank">[wiki]</a>
